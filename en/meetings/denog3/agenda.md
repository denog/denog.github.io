### "Building MPLS-based multicast VPN solutions" - Carsten Michel, Xantaro Deutschland GmbH

There is increasing demand for Multicast functionality, especially in the context of IPTV wholesale and real-time information feeds.

Service providers today use Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) to offer a variety of services on top of a common core network infrastructure. Unfortunately, MPLS was originally designed for unicast IP traffic.

This presentation illustrates how BGP/MPLS based layer-3 VPNs can be extended to support multicast traffic with new concepts recently standardized. Multicast VPN makes use of the concept of point-to-multipoint LSPs to handle multicast traffic in a way such that bandwidth efficiency and scalability is achieved at the same time. The different mechanisms that need to work together to build this solution are discussed.

### "OpenFlow: from Future Internet Research into your Network" - Hans-Joerg Kolbe, NEC Labs Heidelberg

OpenFlow, a child of Stanford's future internet research programme is on the way into productive networks. Separating control and user plane, OpenFlow allows to program network behaviour directly by the network operator, reducing time-to-market for specific solutions and avoiding having to wait for all vendors to implement the desired functionality. With OpenFlow, a centralized controller instance communicates with the network nodes using the standardized OpenFlow protocol. Network applications reside on top of the controller. In the talk, we will present the main concept and functionality. Furthermore, we will present the applicability to data center and carrier networks and the newly available pan-European testbed provided by the EU OFELIA project.

### "Transmission 3 - five thesis for a longer, faster, easier, more reliable & scalable network" - Thomas Weible, Flexoptix

Wouldn't it be fast if we would life in a world where we can transmit 100 000 000 000 single state changes over one single fiber cable?
Wouldn't it be long if we could communicate over a distance of 170km on a naked fiber without any device between and with the speed of 10Gpbs?
Wouldn't it be easy if we would have instant access to all kind of gear which we do not have in hand or forgot to order in advance, but our customer needs the link now and not tomorrow!
How reliable would your network be if it would tell you that next week there will be failure on your link to your upstream provider?
How good would you sleep if you would know that you could scale up your network instantly if you need more bandwidth?

Human mankind is already living in the 2nd part of the Ethernet. Now this here is transmission 3 - come to DeNOG #3 for your better future.

DISCLAIMER: this speech is for technical people only. It is about a collection of optical and non-optical technologies which I have seen, used and worked on in the last 12 month. I think it is worth to mention them because you can use them to make your network longer, faster, easier, more reliable & scalable.

### "Introduction to Torrus and Gerty" - Stanislav Sinyagin

Torrus is a set of new tools which allows to build a service-centric presentation of traffic statistics, and show it in a customer self-service portal.
A bit more detailed explanation is given in Service-centric display: SIAM+Extopus

Gerty is designed to automate all kinds of network administration tasks. The simplest one is to grab all configurations from all network devices and store them on a disk. But there's much more, and there are also NETCONF and SNMP interfaces, as well as SQL interface for data storage.

### "The State of the internet" - Christian Kaufmann, Akamai

Each quarter, Akamai publishes a quarterly "State of the Internet" report. This report includes data gathered across Akamai's global server network about attack traffic, average & maximum connection speeds, Internet penetration and broadband adoption, and mobile usage, as well as trends seen in this data over time.

### "RPKI – Authentication for the Border Gateway Protocol" Sebastian Spies, US National Institute of Standards and Technology

The RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) is meant to provide authentication for the Border Gateway Protocol. The IETF SIDR (Secure Inter-Domain Routing WG) is working on the specification of a set of protocols that enable routers to validate the origin ASN (ROA, Route Origin Authorization) of BGP updates as well as the full AS path (BGPSEC). The US National Institute of Technology (NIST) supports these IETF efforts, i.e. in providing testing and feasibility studies.

First, this presentation gives a technical overview of the RPKI/BGPSEC protocols and how they achieve authentication within the BGP system. Second, it highlights NISTs participation in this field and introduces two projects that are both novel in implementing and testing these protocols.

SRx (Secure Router eXtensions) is a software that validates BGP prefix/origin pairs of BGP updates from a validation cache and marks BGP updates according their validation state. A router (in this case Quagga) can use this information to base its best path selection and filters on it.

BRITE (BGPSEC / RPKI Interoperability Test & Evaluation System) supports the development and deployment of RPKI/BGPSEC security mechanisms. It addresses the testing of new implementations of BGP security protocols and is capable of testing several distinct components/protocols both in isolation and as an integrated system.

### "Ethernet Fabric enabling the Cloud optimized Data Center" - Jörg Ammon, Brocade

Information technology is undergoing a major transformation. Driving this transformation are a number of forcing functions in IT today including the exponential growth in data (video in particular), Internet-connected devices, server workloads and virtualization. The network is the fundamental asset to support this transformation. Therefore, network architectures need to be re-imagined in a way that they can scale, perform and be managed under significantly more rigorous conditions. This presentation give an overview of requirements, challenges and solutions for cloud infrastructures in Data Centers, talking about Ethernet Fabrics and enabling technologies, such as TRILL and others.
