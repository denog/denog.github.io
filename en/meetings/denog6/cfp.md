## GENERAL INFORMATION

DENOG is a community for professionals within Germany who are operating, designing or researching the Internet. It provides a technical forum where those working on, with and for the Internet can come together to solve problems with every aspect of their (net)work.

The meeting is designed to provide an opportunity for the exchange of information among network operators, engineers, researchers and other professionals close to the network community.

## TOPICS FOR PRESENTATIONS/TALKS

The day will be divided into several sessions. The number and length of presentations per session is not fixed, although due to time constraints we would prefer the length of the presentations to be between 15 to 30 minutes.

We especially welcome presentations within the topics below. However, if you have a presentation which falls outside of those topics but fits perfectly in the scope of a network centric conference, you are more than welcome to submit it.

### Topic #1: Issues affecting the global internet infrastructure

Software bugs, route-hijacking incidents and denial of service attacks are common in todays internet. Due to Heartbleed special attention will be given to security and cryptography software and more vulunerabilities are bound to be uncovered. How do those events affect the global internet infrastructure? What can we do to further strengthen security in our networks?

### Topic #2: Peering

Everything about your peering experience. Why are you doing it? How are you doing it? Have you written any useful tools which others might find interesting? What are the issues you are facing?

### Topic #3: Network & resource planning

Around the world we see large companies consuming lots of bandwidth for new media services like YouTube, Netflix, Akamai etc. Forecasting and planning of capactiy is an essential part of quality assurance to keep your users/subscribers happy. What are the best techniques to evaluate traffic levels to certain providers? How to manage the flow of traffic in the best way under the aspect of commerical and engineering views?

### Topic #4: ISP BOF

"All things ISP". From Network/SLA Management (for or against it), abuse handling and log systems to data centre layout and planning (including power and cooling), everything that is interesting to you as an ISP can be presented or discussed within this topic.

### Lightning Talks

In addition to the topics mentioned below we will reserve slots for lightning talks, which consist of a few slides and will not last longer than 5 minutes. Lightning talks can be submitted until November 8th, with the deadline for submission of the corresponding slides being November 13th.

## LANGUAGE OF SLIDES AND TALKS

To appeal to an international audience we ask you to produce your slides in English, but the spoken language of the presentation itself can be either German or English.

## SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

All submissions must have a strong technical bias and must not be solely promotional for your employer.

Please remember that your presentations should be suitable for a target audience of technicians from varied backgrounds, working for companies whose sizes may vary considerably.

To submit a proposal for a presentation, we request that you provide the following information as plain text or PDF format to [denog-pc@denog.de](mailto:denog-pc@denog.de):

- the name of the presenter (and if applicable your affiliation)
- a working email address
- the title of the presentation
- its expected length (in minutes)
- the preferred spoken language for the presentation
- a short abstract of the presentation (not more than 200 words)

We also welcome suggestions for specific presentations which you feel would be valuable to the DENOG community.
