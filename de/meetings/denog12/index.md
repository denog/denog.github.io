Due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation DENOG12 will happen virtually. We will start the conference with a workshop day Sunday, November 8th.
On Monday & Tuesday (November 9/10) the usual conference will take place with (lightning-)talks, chats, group discussions and a chance to meet our sponsors.

DENOG13 will take place in Hamburg in 2021 if the situation allows it. Further details will follow.
