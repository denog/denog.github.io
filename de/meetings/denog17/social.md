## DENOG17 - Sunday PreSocial - Blind Peering (self paid) at 7 p.m
We're excited to organize group dinners across Essen and surroundings for
#DENOG17! You'll be randomly assigned to groups of around eight people to spark
new connections, with a Table Captain who is familiar with DENOG to guide each
group. A couple days before the event, you'll receive an email with your
restaurant details, group members' names, and your Table Captain's contact
info.

Please arrive on time and inform us if you can’t make it. This initiative is
all about mixing up usual groups and meeting new faces! Note that the event is
self-paid, so be prepared to cover your dinner cost. If you don’t cancel by
November 8th, or don’t show up, a cancellation fee may apply, and no-shows can
lead to half-empty tables and missed opportunities for others.

For questions or changes you can contact us at <a href="mailto:event@denog.de">event@denog.de</a>.
