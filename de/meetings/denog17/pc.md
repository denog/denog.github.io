## Expectations for PC members

What does the PC work entail?  Essentially, the Denog Programme Committee (PC)
is responsible for compiling the agenda of the upcoming Denog meeting and
MeetUps to ensure an interesting, engaging, and a diverse programme. As a PC
member you directly contribute to the success of the event.

1) Motivate others
to contribute to DENOG As a PC member you should actively use your personal and
professional networks to engage with potential presenters and bring great
content to the next event. Often many people do not realize they could have
interesting content to present or stories to share!

2) Rate and review
presentation proposals After the call for presentations (CfP) is opened talk
proposals start to arrive in our submission system (Pretalx).  Every PC member
is expected to review all proposals and leave a rating and comment to help us
decide what to accept.

3) Participate in the PC calls After the first CfP
deadline (about two months before the upcoming event) the PC chairs schedule a
call in which the whole PC goes through all submissions and decides which ones
to accept, which speakers to reach out to, etc. Depending of the number and
quality of submissions there may be multiple calls. As a rough estimation you
should make time for three calls of about 90 minutes.

4) Ideally, attend the
upcoming DENOG Of course, as an active contributor to the upcoming event you
should try to attend. Still, your plans may not allow you to join which is
totally acceptable. Attending DENOG is not mandatory for being on the PC - you
just miss the opportunity to see the agenda you've been helping to compile in
action.

5) Help out as Video- or Stage Herald We are always looking for
'Heralds' to moderate and guide through the sessions during DENOG. If you don’t
feel comfortable on stage you can also help as a Video Herald - please reach out
the PC chairs and they will let you know the details.


## Execution of the elections

Everyone has the opportunity to participate in voting for the DENOG PC. Each
member of DENOG e.V. and each checked-in onsite attendee (excluding sponsors)
will have three votes to distribute across all available candidates (up to one
vote per candidate). Voting will open on DENOG Day 2 and close after the
conference on Friday. The elected PC members will be announced on the DENOG
list the following week.

We will use the Voting tool OpaVote. You will receive the email from "OpaVote
Voting Link <noreply@opavote.com>" with the subject "Vote for DENOG PC".

## Volunteering for the DENOG PC

If you are interested in helping to create the great programm for the upcoming
DENOG events then you can do that by running for a seat on the PC. Please send
an email with a picture and a short bio to pc@lists.denog.de.

You can run for the PC until Monday November 18th 20:00 CET.
