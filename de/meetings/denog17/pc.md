# Expectations for PC members

What does the PC work entail?  Essentially, the Denog Programme Committee (PC)
is responsible for compiling the agenda of the upcoming Denog meeting and
MeetUps to ensure an interesting, engaging, and a diverse programme. As a PC
member you directly contribute to the success of the event.

1) Motivate others
to contribute to DENOG As a PC member you should actively use your personal and
professional networks to engage with potential presenters and bring great
content to the next event. Often many people do not realize they could have
interesting content to present or stories to share!

2) Rate and review
presentation proposals After the call for presentations (CfP) is opened talk
proposals start to arrive in our submission system (Pretalx).  Every PC member
is expected to review all proposals and leave a rating and comment to help us
decide what to accept.

3) Participate in the PC calls After the first CfP
deadline (about two months before the upcoming event) the PC chairs schedule a
call in which the whole PC goes through all submissions and decides which ones
to accept, which speakers to reach out to, etc. Depending of the number and
quality of submissions there may be multiple calls. As a rough estimation you
should make time for three calls of about 90 minutes.

4) Ideally, attend the
upcoming DENOG Of course, as an active contributor to the upcoming event you
should try to attend. Still, your plans may not allow you to join which is
totally acceptable. Attending DENOG is not mandatory for being on the PC - you
just miss the opportunity to see the agenda you've been helping to compile in
action.

5) Help out as Video- or Stage Herald We are always looking for
'Heralds' to moderate and guide through the sessions during DENOG. If you don’t
feel comfortable on stage you can also help as a Video Herald - please reach out
the PC chairs and they will let you know the details.


# Elections
## Execution of the elections

<td style="vertical-align:top">
For those who do not know me, my name is Henry Schäfer. I was born and live in
Germany with my wife and daughter, currently in Berlin.<br /><br />

For almost three decades I have been working in the Internet Industry, bringing
extensive experience in IP Networking, spanning Engineering, Design, Core
Network Planning, Interconnection/Peering, Product Development Support, and
Product Management. I joined UUNET in 1999 and have since held various
positions—initially focused on the EMEA region and International data networks,
and later taking on a global scope, now at Verizon. I offer a strong balance of
advanced technology acumen and business skills.<br /><br />

I am running for the Program Committee because I care deeply about the
Internet, including its operation, governance, and ensuring it remains a safe
place for everyone. I believe my experience can contribute a diverse
perspective from many angles to the committee.<br /><br />

Outside of my professional life, I am an active enthusiast of road and off-road
cycling, sailing, and skiing, and have recently taken up swimming.<br /><br />

I would be pleased to support the DENOG community further, particularly in an
elected position such as on the Program Committee.
