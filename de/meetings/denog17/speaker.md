# DENOG17 Sunday Speaker Coaching
This year, we’re excited to offer you something special: The opportunity to run
a test presentation and receive professional feedback ahead of your
presentation from an experienced speaker coach.

We’ve hired a neutral, professional coach who will focus on delivery aspects
such as posture, clarity, presence, and stage confidence. While they won’t
comment on your content, their goal is to help you refine your presentation
skills and bring your delivery to the next level.

Each 1-to-1 coaching session will last about 15–20 minutes and will include:
• A short 2–3 minute run-through of the beginning of your talk in one of our lecture halls.
• Detailed, constructive feedback with practical, last-minute improvement tips.

Date: Sunday, November 9th
Duration: 15–20 minutes per session

To participate, please fill out the form below so we can schedule your session: <a href="https://forms.gle/pkTnQjg8995Nmz259">https://forms.gle/pkTnQjg8995Nmz259</a>

Please note that space is limited. To ensure fairness, we’ll prioritize
first-time or less experienced speakers and allocate remaining slots on a first
come, first served basis.

We’re looking forward to seeing your talks, and to helping you shine on stage
at DENOG17!


# Questions
If you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out to pc@denog.de or event@denog.de, our team is available at the check-in desk during the whole event and will help you with any questions.

We're looking forward to your presentation, and can't wait to welcome you to Berlin!
