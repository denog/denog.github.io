# Event Support

Go to the #InfoPoint Chat in Venueless or email event@denog.de
If you are participating on-site do not hesitate to reach out to our Info Point, which will be staffed during the whole event.

If, during any time at the event - either remote or in person, you feel unwell, unsafe, threatened, etc. please do not hesitate to approach anyone of board members or contact us via vorstand@denog.de


# Helping at the event - be an "Engel" 
DENOG17 is entirely run by volunteers and relies on your participation. If you want to contribute with your skill and strength, meet other people, have a look behind the scenes, or just help out, we invite you to be an "Engel"! 

For most of the roles you don’t need any specific experience and you will learn everything you need for the job in our briefings on-site.
If you’re interested in contributing, here’s how to get involved, the roles and shift available, and what’s expected:


## How to sign up 
<b>Engel System Registration:</b> please register at https://engel.denog.de/register, we ask you to include your real name, email address and phone number so that we can recognize and reach you

<b>Send availability and role selection:</b> Email <b>engel@denog.de</b> with your chosen volunteer role(s) and the specific times you’re available (please find shifts and roles below) 


## What’s expected
We will then group you into the different shifts and roles. There will be an on-site briefing for all Engels every morning and additionally appropriate to the role.
