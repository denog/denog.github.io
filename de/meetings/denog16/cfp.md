The 16th meeting of the German Network Operators Group (DENOG) will take place on the 18th and 19th of November 2024 (all timings are in CET/UTC+1) in Berlin, Germany! Additionally, we host a workshop day on November 17th.
We are pleased to announce that the DENOG16 submission system is open and invite everyone of you to participate by submitting your ideas for workshops, presentations, and lightning talks.

DENOG is a community for professionals operating, designing, or researching the Internet across the D/A/CH region and beyond. It provides a technical forum for everyone working on, with, and for the Internet to come together, discuss, and solve problems in all aspects of their (net)work.

The meeting provides an opportunity for information exchange across all areas of expertise among network operators, engineers, researchers, and other professionals close to the network community.

# Berlin or virtual?

DENOG16 will be a hybrid meeting. The on-site conference takes place in the Estrel Congress Center in Berlin, Germany. Virtual attendance is possible via our venueless platform, this platform will also be the main hub for Q&A and Polls for both forms of attendance.

# Potential topics

Given DENOG’s setup as a hub for the Internet and network community we are looking for presentations covering topics in the range of network engineering and operation, e.g. (but not limited to):

- Network and resource planning
- Datacenter technologies
- Network and routing security
- Internet peering
- Internet Governance
- IPv6 deployment
- Network operations
- Network automation
- RPKI Deployment

We also encourage introductory talks and workshops covering basic understanding for any technology within the networking realm. We explicitly endorse submissions covering non-technical aspects of the Internet industry, e.g., shared experiences in different working environments, psychological or mental health, and sustainability related topics as well as interesting data analytics presentations.

# (Lightning-)Talks

The program committee is seeking presentation proposals from within our community. DENOG16 is organized as a single track meeting, i.e., no parallel presentations. Each presentation has a length of 30min including Q&A. Lightning Talks are limited to 10 minutes.
Feel free to submit as many presentation proposals as you like. We keep a limited amount of Lightning Talk slots available for impromptu topics coming up during the event.

# Workshops

Workshops at DENOG16 provide the community with hands-on experience with striving technologies under the supervision of experts and the like. Workshops are held in smaller groups with 20-50 participants.
Workshops can take from 2 hours up to a whole day (5h total workshop time), length is at your discretion. Workshops will be limited to onsite participants.

Should participants require any preparation (e.g., a Virtual Machine, a Compiler/Interpreter of sorts, etc.) please note so in the description of your workshop.

# Language of Slides and Talks

To appeal to a wide international audience, we ask you to keep the spoken language of your presentation to English and also submit your slides in English. If you do not feel comfortable or able to present in English, please reach out to the program committee.

If a workshop’s audience permits switching to any other language it is at the presenter’s discretion to choose English or German.

# Recordings and Publications

We will publish slides and a video recording of your talk after the event. We kindly ask you to honor the copyright of any media in your presentation. Should you have any concerns regarding any form of publication please get in touch with the program committee before the event. By submitting a proposal, you agree to yourself and to your content being recorded and/or published.

Workshops will not be recorded to encourage participation and remove the fear of asking trivial, yet important, questions.

# Submission Guidelines

All submissions must have a strong technical or other community relevant focus and must not be solely promotional for your employer. We will not accept product or company marketing talks.

To submit a proposal for a presentation, we request that you submit your talk at https://pretalx.com/denog16/cfp.

We will collect all submissions until the deadline for submissions and will collectively vote on all submissions. You will receive feedback during the selection process and after the deadline once the final decision has been made.

We also welcome suggestions for specific presentations which you feel would be valuable to the DENOG community.
