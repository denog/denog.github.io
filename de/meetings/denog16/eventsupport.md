# Event Support

Go to the #InfoPoint Chat in Venueless or email event@denog.de
If you are participating on-site do not hesitate to reach out to our Info Point, which will be staffed during the whole event.

If, during any time at the event - either remote or in person, you feel unwell, unsafe, threatened, etc. please do not hesitate to approach anyone of board members or contact us via vorstand@denog.de


# Helping at the event - be an "Engel" 
DENOG16 is entirely run by volunteers and relies on your participation. If you want to contribute with your skill and strength, meet other people, have a look behind the scenes, or just help out, we invite you to be an "Engel"! 

For most of the roles you don’t need any specific experience and you will learn everything you need for the job in our briefings on-site.
If you’re interested in contributing, here’s how to get involved, the roles and shift available, and what’s expected:


## How to sign up

<b>Send availability and role selection:</b> Email <b>engel@denog.de</b> with your chosen volunteer role(s) and the specific times you’re available (please find shifts and roles below) 


## What’s expected
We will then group you into the different shifts and roles. There will be an on-site briefing for all Engels every morning and additionally appropriate to the role.

## Description of different Engel roles 
In the following we’d like to describe the different roles throughout the event, so that you can get an idea about the different takes. 


### Check-In & Info Point
The Check-In & Info Point Engel helps at the central contact point of the conference, the Info Point. This is where visitors come to register and when they have questions or need something.

Tasks:
- Welcoming conference visitors (attendees), scanning ticket QR codes
- Handing out badges and conference T-shirts, etc.
- Pointing out features at the conference such as the attendee wall or job board
- Listening to and solving attendee requests


### Attendee Wall 
Next to the Info Point and in the process of check-in the next station will be the Attendee Wall. We’ll shoot an instant photo of every attendee and pin it to a big pin board. 

Tasks:
- Make an instant photo of every new attendee
- Pin it to the wall and stick a sticker with the attendee's details underneath. 


### Herald
The Herald Engel is on stage and helps to ensure and moderate a smooth program flow.

Tasks:
- Preparation of the speaker 
- Introduction and closing of the speakers, talks and workshops
- Moderating questions in the subsequent Q&A


### General Support
The General Support Engel is a true Engel-for-all, the universal genius. Helping out wherever help is needed. 

Tasks:
- Be flexible and ready to get stuck in :)


### Social Build-up Engel
The Social Build-up Engel is helping with building up and preparing the Social event. Important: You need to be ok with leaving the conference location on Monday in the early afternoon.


### Open House Call 
This call is aimed to give a brief overview and give space for a Q&A. 

Next Thursday, November 14th at 19:00 the link will be sent to the signal group 


We appreciate your willingness to support us in making this event a success, and we’re here to answer any questions as you sign up.
Thank you for considering this opportunity, and we look forward to working together!
Warm regards,
