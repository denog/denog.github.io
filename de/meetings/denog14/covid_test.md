# Hygiene Concept

DENOG14 is our first in-person conference since the start of the ongoing COVID19 pandemic. Especially in our field, where many people work on critical infrastructure, we must take responsibility to ensure a safe event.

We will provide a free-of-charge dedicated COVID testing facility on site and require attendees to test daily before entering the event location.
We encourage participants to wear masks.

The testing facility ons-ite is open during the following hours, estimated time to result is approx. 10 min:
* Sunday, Nov. 13th: 09.30 - 15.30 CET
* Monday, Nov. 14th: 08.30 - 15.30 CET
* Tuesday, Nov. 15th: 08.00 - 13.30 CET

The test center uses [LumiraDx Antigen Tests](https://www.lumiradx.com/uk-en/test-menu/antigen-test) which provide a 97.6% positive agreement versus RT-PCR in patients tested within 12 days of the onset of symptoms.
