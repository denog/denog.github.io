# Hygiene Concept

DENOG14 is our first in-person conference since the start of the ongoing COVID19 pandemic. Especially in our field, where many people work on critical infrastructure, we must take responsibility to ensure a safe event.

We will provide a free-of-charge dedicated COVID testing facility on site and require attendees to test daily before entering the event location. We encourage participants to wear masks.

The testing facility will be located in front of the main entrance in a tent. Every person in the venue (participant, speaker, personnel of the location, …) needs to be tested daily. The tests are processed in batches and will take between 5 and 15 minutes. Please plan your arrival time accordingly. There will be colored wristlets with one color for each day. 

The testing facility on-site is open during the following hours:

Sunday, Nov. 13th: 09:30 - 15:30 CET

Monday, Nov. 14th: 08:30 - 15:30 CET

Tuesday, Nov. 15th: 08:00 - 13:30 CET

The test center uses LumiraDx Antigen Tests which provide a 97.6% positive agreement versus RT-PCR in patients tested within 12 days of the onset of symptoms.
